# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### Project Definition
**Objective:**
- Predict the probability of loan default based on an applicant's profile and financial data.
- Provide actionable insights to financial institutions for making informed lending decisions.

### Data Collection
**Datasets:**
- **Primary Source:** Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk/data)
- **Secondary Sources:** Anonymized datasets from financial institutions (if accessible).

**Features:**
- **Demographic Information:** Age, gender, marital status, education, employment status.
- **Financial History:** Number of previous loans, repayment history, current debts.
- **Credit Bureau Data:** Credit scores, number of credit inquiries, public records.
- **Behavioral Data:** Transaction history, account balances, spending patterns.

### Data Preprocessing
**Cleaning:**
- Handle missing values using methods like imputation or deletion.
- Detect and address outliers using statistical techniques or domain knowledge.
- Resolve data inconsistencies.

**Normalization/Standardization:**
- Scale numerical features using standardization (Z-score) or normalization (Min-Max scaling).

**Encoding:**
- Convert categorical variables using one-hot encoding for nominal features.
- Use label encoding or target encoding for ordinal features.

**Feature Engineering:**
- Create features like debt-to-income ratio, credit utilization rate, loan-to-value ratio.
- Generate interaction features if they add value to the model.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Visualization:**
- Use histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to understand feature distributions.
- Create correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify relationships between features and the target variable.

**Insights:**
- Identify key predictors of default.
- Detect multicollinearity among features.

### 5. Model Development
**Model Selection:**
- Experiment with baseline models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
- Explore advanced models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

**Training:**
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

**Hyperparameter Tuning:**
- Use Grid Search or Random Search with cross-validation to find optimal hyperparameters.

**Cross-Validation:**
- Apply k-fold cross-validation (e.g., k=5) to assess model robustness.

### 6. Model Evaluation
**Metrics:**
- Evaluate models using AUC-ROC, Precision-Recall curves, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.

**Interpretability:**
- Utilize SHAP or LIME for model interpretation.
- Ensure fairness by checking for biases across different demographic groups.

### 7. Model Deployment
**API Development:**
- Develop a RESTful API using Flask or FastAPI to serve the model.

**Integration:**
- Integrate the API with front-end applications or existing financial systems for real-time scoring.

**Monitoring:**
- Implement monitoring tools to track model performance over time.
- Set up alerts for performance degradation or data drift.

### 8. Documentation and Reporting
**Documentation:**
- Document all steps including data sources, preprocessing methods, model development, and evaluation metrics.

**Reporting:**
- Create visual reports using tools like Jupyter Notebook or dashboards using Tableau/PowerBI.
- Present findings and model performance to stakeholders through detailed reports and presentations.

### 9. Future Enhancements
**Continuous Learning:**
- Develop a pipeline for periodic model retraining with new data.

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Explore ensemble methods to combine multiple models.
- Investigate transfer learning for leveraging pre-trained models.
- Incorporate alternative data sources, such as social media behavior or mobile phone usage patterns, if permissible.

### Implementation Steps
**Data Collection:**
- Download and inspect the Kaggle dataset.
- Perform initial data cleaning (e.g., handle missing values).

**Data Preprocessing and EDA:**
- Clean and preprocess the data thoroughly.
- Conduct EDA to gain insights into data distribution and relationships.

**Model Development:**
- Develop and train multiple models, starting with simple ones and progressing to complex ones.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics.
- Use interpretability techniques to understand model predictions.

**Model Deployment:**
- Develop an API to deploy the model.
- Monitor the model in production to ensure it remains effective.

**Documentation and Reporting:**
- Thoroughly document the entire project.
- Create final reports and presentations for stakeholders.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, SHAP, LIME, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **API Framework:** Flask or FastAPI
- **Deployment:** Docker, AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting
